                    <p> Have not heard from you for a few days - hope you and dad are doing well!<br>
                        I have been pretty busy with exams recently, so I completely forgot to send you my personal
                        media
                        biography that you asked about the other day. I have attached it to this digital postcard. I
                        really
                        hope it was worth the wait! I also can't wait to see you over the easter break skiing in Austria
                        - it
                        is
                        going to be so much fun!
                        <br>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Recently I have only listened to songs and watched videos that make me feel happy. I would like to
                    have a dog one day, but as you know I'm allergic. like to one day have a beagle, but sadly I am
                    allergic to dogs. But when it comes to youtube I also like to watch interesting chemistry or physics
                    labs.</p>
