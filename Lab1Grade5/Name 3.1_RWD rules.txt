I had the three columns divided into div boxes with ids (left, middle, right) inside my main tags.
I used a blend of grid and flex layout.
For the mobile screen width I stacked the boxes under eachother, making the originally three column website a one column.
I decided to hide the middle section while there was no 3D product showing so it would not have an empty box as the top box.
Inside the grids I used flex boxes which made it easy to stack smaller boxes to each other.
Most used rules: flex-direction, shrink, grow, grid-column, grid-row



@media only screen and (max-width: Ypx) {} where Y is the max width
Mobile screen max width 480 px, 
Tablet screen max width 768 px, 
Computer screen everything above 768px
